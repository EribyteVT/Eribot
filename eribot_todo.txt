GLITCHES TO FIX:
1. schedule image day is based off of utc, not timezone (8pm central shows as the next day) [further investigation off stream I fuckin guess]
2. Add events sometimes sends empty message which results in an error [also look into this later]
3. some system messages are not ephemeral [Fixed]

then:

add back in delete stream option
in discord.py is there a discord.SelectOption thing? -- stux says u can have a date picker with this (useful for edit time modal)


work on the auto update
